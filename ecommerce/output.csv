<p><strong>HOW YOUR CHAIRS ARE MADE</strong></p>
<p>We're proud to say that your occasional chair will be handmade and printed to precision by our upholstery professionals. Up to four elements of the chair are printed onto ChiChi fabric, cut to size and then hand stitched and assembled to ensure an excellent finish. The frame and tapered legs are constructed using responsibly sourced beech wood that provides a sturdy and robust structure. We use specialist dye sublimation so the ink is fused deep into the fibres of the fabric, creating a gorgeous permanent print that won't fade, rub or peel away. The plump cushioning is made from firm foam, wadding and webbing, creating a highly comfortable seat to kick back and relax on.</p>
<p><strong>DIMENSIONS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Full height 74cm, full width 63cm, seat depth 49cm</li>
<li>Front leg height 23cm, back leg height 19cm</li>
<li>Backrest height 55cm, backrest width 50cm</li>
<li>Weighs 7kg</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CARE INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>
<p>Our ChiChi Furnishing Velour fabric is fire retardant, so your chair can easily be wiped down with a damp cloth. Give it a regular brush to keep the fibres soft, smooth and in pristine condition.</p>

<p><strong>HOW YOUR CHAIRS ARE MADE</strong></p>
<p>We're proud to say that your occasional chair will be handmade and printed to precision by our upholstery professionals. Up to four elements of the chair are printed onto ChiChi fabric, cut to size and then hand stitched and assembled to ensure an excellent finish. The frame and tapered legs are constructed using responsibly sourced beech wood that provides a sturdy and robust structure. We use specialist dye sublimation so the ink is fused deep into the fibres of the fabric, creating a gorgeous permanent print that won't fade, rub or peel away. The plump cushioning is made from firm foam, wadding and webbing, creating a highly comfortable seat to kick back and relax on.</p>
<p><strong>DIMENSIONS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Full height 74cm, full width 63cm, seat depth 49cm</li>
<li>Front leg height 23cm, back leg height 19cm</li>
<li>Backrest height 55cm, backrest width 50cm</li>
<li>Weighs 7kg</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CARE INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>
<p>Our ChiChi Furnishing Velour fabric is fire retardant, so your chair can easily be wiped down with a damp cloth. Give it a regular brush to keep the fibres soft, smooth and in pristine condition.</p>

<p><strong>HOW YOUR CHAIRS ARE MADE</strong></p>
<p>We're proud to say that your occasional chair will be handmade and printed to precision by our upholstery professionals. Up to four elements of the chair are printed onto ChiChi fabric, cut to size and then hand stitched and assembled to ensure an excellent finish. The frame and tapered legs are constructed using responsibly sourced beech wood that provides a sturdy and robust structure. We use specialist dye sublimation so the ink is fused deep into the fibres of the fabric, creating a gorgeous permanent print that won't fade, rub or peel away. The plump cushioning is made from firm foam, wadding and webbing, creating a highly comfortable seat to kick back and relax on.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>CARE INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>
<p>Our ChiChi Furnishing Velour fabric is fire retardant, so your chair can easily be wiped down with a damp cloth. Give it a regular brush to keep the fibres soft, smooth and in pristine condition.</p>

<p>We're proud to say that your occasional chair will be handmade and printed to precision by our upholstery professionals. Up to four elements of the chair are printed onto ChiChi fabric, cut to size and then hand stitched and assembled to ensure an excellent finish. The frame and tapered legs are constructed using responsibly sourced beech wood that provides a sturdy and robust structure. We use specialist dye sublimation so the ink is fused deep into the fibres of the fabric, creating a gorgeous permanent print that won't fade, rub or peel away. The plump cushioning is made from firm foam, wadding and webbing, creating a highly comfortable seat to kick back and relax on.</p>
<p><strong>DIMENSIONS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Full height 74cm, full width 63cm, seat depth 49cm</li>
<li>Front leg height 23cm, back leg height 19cm</li>

<li>Weighs 7kg</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CARE INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>
<p>Our ChiChi Furnishing Velour fabric is fire retardant, so your chair can easily be wiped down with a damp cloth. Give it a regular brush to keep the fibres soft, smooth and in pristine condition.</p>

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">We're proud to say that your occasional chair will be handmade and printed to precision by our upholstery professionals. Up to four elements of the chair are printed onto ChiChi fabric, cut to size and then hand stitched and assembled to ensure an excellent finish. The frame and tapered legs are constructed using responsibly sourced beech wood that provides a sturdy and robust structure. We use specialist dye sublimation so the ink is fused deep into the fibres of the fabric, creating a gorgeous permanent print that won't fade, rub or peel away. The plump cushioning is made from firm foam, wadding and webbing, creating a highly comfortable seat to kick back and relax on.</p>

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">We're proud to say that your occasional chair will be handmade and printed to precision by our upholstery professionals. Up to four elements of the chair are printed onto ChiChi fabric, cut to size and then hand stitched and assembled to ensure an excellent finish. The frame and tapered legs are constructed using responsibly sourced beech wood that provides a sturdy and robust structure. We use specialist dye sublimation so the ink is fused deep into the fibres of the fabric, creating a gorgeous permanent print that won't fade, rub or peel away. The plump cushioning is made from firm foam, wadding and webbing, creating a highly comfortable seat to kick back and relax on.</p>

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">We're proud to say that your occasional chair will be handmade and printed to precision by our upholstery professionals. Up to four elements of the chair are printed onto ChiChi fabric, cut to size and then hand stitched and assembled to ensure an excellent finish. The frame and tapered legs are constructed using responsibly sourced beech wood that provides a sturdy and robust structure. We use specialist dye sublimation so the ink is fused deep into the fibres of the fabric, creating a gorgeous permanent print that won't fade, rub or peel away. The plump cushioning is made from firm foam, wadding and webbing, creating a highly comfortable seat to kick back and relax on.</p>

<p>We're proud to say that your occasional chair will be handmade and printed to precision by our upholstery professionals. Up to four elements of the chair are printed onto ChiChi fabric, cut to size and then hand stitched and assembled to ensure an excellent finish. The frame and tapered legs are constructed using responsibly sourced beech wood that provides a sturdy and robust structure. We use specialist dye sublimation so the ink is fused deep into the fibres of the fabric, creating a gorgeous permanent print that won't fade, rub or peel away. The plump cushioning is made from firm foam, wadding and webbing, creating a highly comfortable seat to kick back and relax on.</p>
<p><strong>DIMENSIONS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Full height 74cm, full width 63cm, seat depth 49cm</li>
<li>Front leg height 23cm, back leg height 19cm</li>
<li>Backrest height 55cm, backrest width 50cm</li>
<li>Weighs 7kg</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CARE INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>
<p>Our ChiChi Furnishing Velour fabric is fire retardant, so your chair can easily be wiped down with a damp cloth. Give it a regular brush to keep the fibres soft, smooth and in pristine condition.</p>

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">We're proud to say that your occasional chair will be handmade and printed to precision by our upholstery professionals. Up to four elements of the chair are printed onto ChiChi fabric, cut to size and then hand stitched and assembled to ensure an excellent finish. The frame and tapered legs are constructed using responsibly sourced beech wood that provides a sturdy and robust structure. We use specialist dye sublimation so the ink is fused deep into the fibres of the fabric, creating a gorgeous permanent print that won't fade, rub or peel away. The plump cushioning is made from firm foam, wadding and webbing, creating a highly comfortable seat to kick back and relax on.</p>

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">We're proud to say that your occasional chair will be handmade and printed to precision by our upholstery professionals. Up to four elements of the chair are printed onto ChiChi fabric, cut to size and then hand stitched and assembled to ensure an excellent finish. The frame and tapered legs are constructed using responsibly sourced beech wood that provides a sturdy and robust structure. We use specialist dye sublimation so the ink is fused deep into the fibres of the fabric, creating a gorgeous permanent print that won't fade, rub or peel away. The plump cushioning is made from firm foam, wadding and webbing, creating a highly comfortable seat to kick back and relax on.</p>

<p data-mce-fragment=""1"">We're proud to say that your occasional chair will be handmade and printed to precision by our upholstery professionals. Up to four elements of the chair are printed onto ChiChi fabric, cut to size and then hand stitched and assembled to ensure an excellent finish. The frame and tapered legs are constructed using responsibly sourced beech wood that provides a sturdy and robust structure. We use specialist dye sublimation so the ink is fused deep into the fibres of the fabric, creating a gorgeous permanent print that won't fade, rub or peel away. The plump cushioning is made from firm foam, wadding and webbing, creating a highly comfortable seat to kick back and relax on.</p>

We use specialist dye sublimation so the ink is fused deep into the fibres of the fabric, creating a gorgeous permanent print that won't fade, rub or peel away. The plump cushioning is made from firm foam, wadding and webbing, creating a highly comfortable seat to kick back and relax on.</p>
